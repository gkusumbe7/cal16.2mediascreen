        <h2>Travelling</h2>
        <p><b> whether it is to another country or just the town next to yours â€“ is a unique and enriching
            experience that offers a much-needed escape from the challenges of everyday life. You get to explore new places, interact with people different from you, and grow as a process.

        <h2>Photography or videography</h2>
        <p><b>
            Don't just take selfies on your trip; try your hand at professional photography. You can use your smartphone or carry around a small camera with you.
            Some smartphones will give you more or less the same capabilities as professional cameras will. 
            Take photos of the landscape, museums, or any other fascinating features. To make it more appealing, learn how to edit photos or videos and try creating professional-level content.
            You can use your photos or videos as a journal for your travels. 
            Your videos can also make wonderful keepsakes for all the new friends you may meet on your trips or for your family back home.
